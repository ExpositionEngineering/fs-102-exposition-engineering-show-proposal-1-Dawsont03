## 🎉 Show Description

We enter the show with the host and Greg in frame. I give an intro and a summary about what the podcast is. From there, I allow Greg to introduce himself and talk about what he does and what he has done in the past. Then I give insight into what this episode will be about.

I ask the first sample question and Greg responds with the reasons why he chose his major. We can go back and foth for a few minutes and the process. Then I'll flow into asking about if he wanted to be a proffesor.

Once we fill the time up with content, we will then fade into what he would do differently. This will be important for our listeners trying to decide a major.
